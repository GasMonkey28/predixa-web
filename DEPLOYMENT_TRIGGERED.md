# 🚀 Deployment Triggered!

## What I Did

✅ **Pushed commit to GitHub** - This will trigger Vercel to automatically redeploy  
✅ **Commit message:** "Add AWS_DEFAULT_REGION environment variable"  
✅ **Vercel will deploy** with all your environment variables

---

## Check Vercel Deployment

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `predixa-web` project
3. Go to **Deployments** tab
4. You should see a new deployment in progress (or just completed)
5. Wait for it to finish (~1-2 minutes)

**Look for:** "Building" → "Ready" ✅

## After Deployment is Ready

### Test Profile Editing:

1. Go to: https://www.predixasweb.com/account
2. Sign in with Google (or Apple)
3. Edit your name
4. Click **Save**
5. Should work now! ✅

### Verify in DynamoDB:

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
2. Click **"UserProfiles"** table
3. Click **"Explore items"**
4. You should see your profile from production! 🎉

## What Changed

**Environment Variable Added:**
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1`

**Why This Fixes It:**
- Without it: AWS SDK doesn't know which region to use ❌
- With it: AWS SDK connects to DynamoDB in `us-east-1` ✅

## Summary

✅ Code pushed to GitHub  
✅ Vercel deploying now  
✅ Environment variables configured  
✅ IAM permissions set  

Once deployment finishes, **everything should work!** 🎉

## Next Steps

1. Wait for Vercel deployment to finish
2. Test on production site
3. Check DynamoDB for your profile
4. Celebrate! 🎊
