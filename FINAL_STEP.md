# ‚úÖ Final Step: Just Add One More Environment Variable

## What You Already Have

‚úÖ `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Already in Vercel  
‚úÖ `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Already in Vercel  
‚úÖ IAM permissions - Already added to your IAM users  

## What's Missing

‚ùå `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - Add this to Vercel

---

## Add to Vercel

1. In Vercel dashboard, click **"Add New"** environment variable
2. Add:
   - **Name:** `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
   - **Value:** `us-east-1`
   - **Environments:** Select all (Production, Preview, Development)
3. Click **Save**

---

## Redeploy

1. Click **"Redeploy"** button in the notification
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment to finish
3. Test profile editing on production site

---

## Why This Fixes It

The API route needs `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` to know which AWS region to use. Without it, the AWS SDK doesn't know where your DynamoDB table is.

**With it:** ‚úÖ SDK connects to `us-east-1` DynamoDB table  
**Without it:** ‚ùå SDK doesn't know which region to use

## After Redeploy

1. Go to: https://www.predixasweb.com/account
2. Edit your profile
3. Click Save
4. Should work! ‚úÖ
5. Check DynamoDB - you should see your profile!

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **Keep** your existing AWS credentials  
‚úÖ **Add** `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1`  
‚úÖ **Redeploy**  
‚úÖ **Done!** üéâ
