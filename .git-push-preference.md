# Git Push Preferences

## OptiSpark Submodule (iOS App)

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT push the OptiSpark submodule to GitHub unless the user explicitly requests it.

- The user handles pushing iOS changes from another computer
- Only commit OptiSpark changes locally
- Never run `git push` in the OptiSpark directory
- The user will push OptiSpark changes manually from their other computer

## Main Repository

- Normal push behavior is fine for the main repository (predixa-web)
- Push website, Lambda, and other non-iOS changes as usual
