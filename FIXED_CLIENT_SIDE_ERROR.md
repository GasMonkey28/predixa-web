# ✅ Fixed: Client-Side AWS SDK Error

## Problem

You were getting this error:
```
Error: Cannot find module './vendor-chunks/@aws-sdk.js'
```

**Why**: AWS SDK packages (`@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb`, `@aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb`) can only be imported in server-side code, not in client components.

---

## Solution Applied

✅ **Removed client-side imports** - AWS SDK no longer imported in `auth-store.ts`  
✅ **Created API route** - `/api/user/profile` for server-side DynamoDB operations  
✅ **Fallback pattern** - Try Cognito first, use API route for OAuth users  

---

## How It Works Now

### Email Users:
```javascript
Update profile → Cognito attributes → ✅ Works
```

### Google/Apple Users:
```javascript
Update profile → Cognito → ❌ No scope 
               → API route → DynamoDB → ✅ Works
```

---

## Test It

The dev server should be restarting. Once it's ready:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Sign in with any method (email/Google/Apple)
3. Try editing your profile
4. Should work! ✨

---

## What Changed

1. **auth-store.ts** - Removed AWS SDK imports, uses API route for OAuth users
2. **api/user/profile/route.ts** - New server-side API for DynamoDB operations
3. **Clean restart** - Cleared .next cache to rebuild

---

## Ready!

Your app should load now without the module error! 🎉
