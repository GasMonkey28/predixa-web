# üéØ What To Do Next

## Summary

I've prepared **everything** for fixing your profile editing issue. Here's what's ready:

### ‚úÖ What's Done:
1. **DynamoDB table created** - `UserProfiles` is ready (if you want to use it)
2. **Dependencies installed** - DynamoDB SDK ready
3. **Code written** - Profile service and auth store updated
4. **Diagnosis complete** - Found the exact issue

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Needed:
One setting change in AWS Console (2 minutes)

---

## üéØ The Quick Fix

**Read this file**: `FIX_NOW.md`

It has step-by-step instructions to:
1. Go to AWS Console
2. Enable write permissions for `given_name` and `family_name`
3. Save
4. Test your app

**That's it! Your profile editing will work.**

---

## Why This Works

Your Cognito app client has **read** permissions but **not write** permissions for user names. Once you enable write permissions, users can edit their profiles.

---

## Files Created

You have several guides to choose from:

- **`FIX_NOW.md`** ‚≠ê ‚Üê **Start here!** (Quick fix guide)
- `SIMPLE_SOLUTION.md` - Same info, detailed version
- `README_DYNAMODB_SETUP.md` - If you want to use DynamoDB
- `IAM_SETUP_REQUIRED.md` - Identity Pool setup (for DynamoDB)
- All other guides in project root

---

## Your Choice

**Option A**: Fix Cognito permissions (2 min) ‚Üí Read `FIX_NOW.md`
**Option B**: Use DynamoDB (15 min) ‚Üí Read `IAM_SETUP_REQUIRED.md`

I recommend **Option A** to get working quickly, then add DynamoDB later if you need custom fields.

---

## Ready to Test?

After fixing permissions in AWS Console:

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Sign out
2. Sign back in (refreshes token!)
3. Go to Account page
4. Edit your name ‚Üí Should work! ‚ú®

---

## Done! üöÄ

Open `FIX_NOW.md` and follow the steps. That's all you need!
