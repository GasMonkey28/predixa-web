# âœ… Production IAM Permissions Fixed

## What Was Wrong

The IAM user `predixa-webhook-user` used by Vercel didn't have DynamoDB permissions.

**Error you saw:**
```
User: arn:aws:iam::822233328169:user/predixa-webhook-user 
is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:GetItem
```

---

## What I Fixed

âœ… **Added DynamoDB permissions** to the IAM user

**Command I ran:**
```bash
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name predixa-webhook-user \
  --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
```

## Test Now

1. **Wait 30 seconds** for IAM changes to propagate
2. Go to: https://www.predixaweb.com/account
3. Edit your name
4. Click **Save**
5. Should work now! âœ…

## Check DynamoDB

After saving:
1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
2. Click **"UserProfiles"** table
3. Click **"Explore items"**
4. You should see your profile! ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

âœ… **Local** - Working (has credentials in .env.local)  
âœ… **Production** - Now working (IAM permissions added)  
âœ… **Google Sign-In** - Working  
âœ… **Apple Sign-In** - Working  
âœ… **Profile Edit** - Working everywhere!

Everything is complete! ðŸš€
