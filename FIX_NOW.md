# ‚úÖ Fix Profile Editing - Do This Now

## üéØ Quick Fix (2 minutes)

You need to enable write permissions for `given_name` and `family_name` in your Cognito app client.

---

## Option 1: AWS Console (EASIEST) ‚≠ê

### Steps:

1. **Go to AWS Cognito Console**
   - https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/v2/idp/user-pools
   - Select your user pool: `us-east-1_iYC6qs6H2` (User pool - g5anv7)

2. **Navigate to App Clients**
   - Left sidebar ‚Üí **Applications** ‚Üí **App clients**
   - Click on **"predixa"** (your app client)

3. **Edit App Client**
   - Click **"Edit"** button at the top
   - Scroll down to find **"Attribute permissions"** section

4. **Enable Write Permissions**
   - Look for **"Write"** or **"Writable attributes"** 
   - Check these boxes:
     - ‚òë `email`
     - ‚òë `given_name` ‚Üê **This is the key one!**
     - ‚òë `family_name` ‚Üê **This too!**

5. **Save**
   - Click **"Save changes"** at the bottom
   - If you see a warning about OAuth, click **"Confirm"**

## ‚úÖ Test It!

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. **Sign out** of your app (important to refresh token!)
2. **Sign back in**
3. Go to **Account page**
4. Click **"Edit"** on your name
5. Change your name and click **"Save"**
6. **Should work now!** ‚ú®

---

## What This Fixed

**Before**: App client didn't have permission to update `given_name` and `family_name` ‚Üí Permission denied error

**After**: App client has write access ‚Üí Users can edit their names! ‚úÖ

---

## Why This Works

Cognito app clients have separate **read** and **write** permissions. Your app could read user names but couldn't write them. Now it can both read and write, so profile editing works!

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Make sure you signed out and back in (refreshes the token)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try clearing browser cache
4. Contact me with the error message

---

## Done! üéâ

You can now delete the DynamoDB table if you don't want it:
```bash
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name UserProfiles --region us-east-1
```

Or keep it for future features!
