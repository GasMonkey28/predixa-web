# ✨ SIMPLEST Solution - Just Fix Cognito Permissions!

You don't need DynamoDB at all. The issue is just missing write permissions in your Cognito app client.

## The Real Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Cognito Console
- Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/
- Click **User pools**
- Click your pool (`g5anv7`)

### Step 2: Navigate to App Client
- In left sidebar → **Applications** → **App clients**
- Click on your app client

### Step 3: Enable Write Permissions ⭐
Look for **"Write attributes"** or **"Attribute permissions"**

Check these boxes:
- ☑ `given_name` 
- ☑ `family_name`

### Step 4: Save
- Click **"Save changes"**
- Click **"Confirm"** if warned

### Step 5: Test
```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Sign out
2. Sign back in (refreshes token)
3. Go to Account page
4. Click Edit → Make changes → Click Save
5. **Should work now!** ✨

## If You Want DynamoDB Later...

The DynamoDB approach I built is ready if you want:
- Custom profile fields
- More complex user data
- Better scalability

But for now, **just fix the Cognito permissions** and you're done!

## Which Files to Use?

**Option A: Use Cognito Fix (Simplest)**
- Just enable write permissions above
- Delete DynamoDB table if you don't want it
- Keep using `auth-store.ts` as-is

**Option B: Use DynamoDB (Better long-term)**
- Keep DynamoDB table (already created)
- Set up Identity Pool (see `IAM_SETUP_REQUIRED.md`)
- Uses the new `user-profile-service.ts`

**You can do both - try the Cognito fix first, then add DynamoDB later if you want extra features.**
