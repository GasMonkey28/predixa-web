# ðŸ”§ Final Fix - Clean Restart

## What I Did

âœ… **Killed dev server** - Stopped all Node processes  
âœ… **Cleared caches** - Removed `.next` and cache directories  
âœ… **Started fresh** - New clean build in progress  

---

## Wait For Dev Server

The dev server is starting now. You should see in the terminal:

```
âœ“ Ready in [time]ms
```

**Important**: Don't refresh the browser until you see "Ready"!

---

## Once Ready:

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port it shows)
2. If you see "missing required error components" or blank page:
   - **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or: Open DevTools (F12) â†’ Network â†’ Check "Disable cache" â†’ Refresh

---

## Current Status

âœ… **AWS SDK imports** - Only in API routes (server-side)  
âœ… **No client-side AWS SDK** - All client code cleaned  
âœ… **API route created** - `/api/user/profile` ready  
âœ… **DynamoDB ready** - Table exists  
âœ… **Identity Pool ready** - Just need to add ID to `.env.local`  

---

## If Page Still Looks Weird

The cache clear might need time. Wait 30 seconds, then:

1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Run:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
   npm run dev
   ```

---

## What Changed Summary

- âœ… Removed all client-side AWS SDK imports
- âœ… API route for OAuth users
- âœ… Clean build cache
- âœ… Fresh restart

Everything should work now! Just wait for compilation to finish. ðŸŽ‰
