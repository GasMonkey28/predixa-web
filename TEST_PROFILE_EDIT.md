# âœ… Profile Edit Should Work Now!

## What I Fixed

Since the Cognito permissions ARE already enabled (I can see `given_name` and `family_name` are writable), I:

1. âœ… Reverted the code to use Cognito attributes directly
2. âœ… Removed the DynamoDB dependency (not needed since permissions work)
3. âœ… The code now updates Cognito attributes as originally intended

---

## Test It Now!

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. **Sign out** of your app (important - refreshes token!)
2. **Sign back in**
3. Go to **Account page**
4. Click **"Edit"** on your name
5. Change your name
6. Click **"Save"**

**Should work now!** âœ¨

## What Was The Problem?

Looking at your screenshot, the permissions WERE already correct:
- âœ… `given_name` - Read âœ“, Write âœ“
- âœ… `family_name` - Read âœ“, Write âœ“

So the issue was that the code I wrote earlier was trying to use DynamoDB, which requires more setup (Identity Pool, IAM roles, etc.).

Now it just uses Cognito attributes directly, which works with your existing permissions!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. **Sign out and back in** (critical step!)
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Make sure you're testing with a user that has the permissions

## Next Steps

### You Can Delete DynamoDB Table (Optional)

Since we're not using DynamoDB anymore, you can clean it up:

```bash
aws dynamodb delete-table --table-name UserProfiles --region us-east-1
```

Or keep it for future use!

## Done! ðŸŽ‰

The simplest solution was the right one - just use Cognito attributes with your existing permissions!
