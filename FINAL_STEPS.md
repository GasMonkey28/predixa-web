# âœ… Final Steps - Google/Apple Sign-In

## What I Did

âœ… **Killed all Node processes** - No more port conflicts  
âœ… **Cleared build cache** - Fresh start  
âœ… **Started clean dev server** - Should be on port 3000  

---

## Important: Wait for Ready

The dev server is compiling. **Wait until you see:**
```
âœ“ Ready in [time]ms
```

---

## Then Test Google/Apple Sign-In

1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Sign In"
3. Try "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Apple"
4. Should work now! âœ¨

## If It Still Redirects to Wrong Port

If you get "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" on port 3001:

1. **Make sure you're on port 3000** - Check the URL
2. **Open a new incognito/private window** - Clears OAuth cookies
3. **Try again** - Should redirect properly

---

## Current Setup

âœ… **Server**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`  
âœ… **OAuth Redirects**: Configured for ports 3000 and 3001  
âœ… **Code**: Fixed and clean  

Everything should work now! Just wait for the server to finish compiling. ðŸš€
