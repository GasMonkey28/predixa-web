# ✅ Fixed: Account Page Now Displays DynamoDB Data

## The Problem

Profile updates saved to DynamoDB from production, but the account page didn't display the updated names.

---

## The Fix

Updated `checkAuth` function in `auth-store.ts` to:

1. **Fetch from Cognito** (for email users)
2. **Fetch from DynamoDB** (for OAuth users who edited their profile)
3. **Prioritize DynamoDB** data (most recent)

---

## How It Works Now

### Email Users:
```
Sign in → Edit profile → Saves to Cognito → Displays from Cognito ✅
```

### Google/Apple Users:
```
Sign in → Edit profile → Saves to DynamoDB → checkAuth fetches from DynamoDB → Displays! ✅
```

---

## What Changed

**Before:**
```typescript
checkAuth: only fetches Cognito attributes
Result: DynamoDB names not shown ❌
```

**After:**
```typescript
checkAuth: fetches Cognito + DynamoDB
Result: Shows latest name from DynamoDB ✅
```
